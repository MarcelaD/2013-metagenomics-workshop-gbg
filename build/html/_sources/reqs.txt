Checking required software
==========================================
An often occuring theme in bioinformatics is installing software. Learning how
to check whether you actually have the required software is the first step.

Programs used in this workshop
==============================
The following programs are used in this workshop::
    
    xclip
    bowtie2
    bowtie2-build
    velveth
    velvetg
    parallel
    tablet
    samtools

Using which to locate a program
===============================
An easy way to determine whether you have have a certain program installed is
by typing::

    $ which programname
    
where ``programname`` is the name of the program you want to use. The program
``which`` searches all directories for the executable file ``programname`` and
returns the path of the first found hit. This is exactly what happens when you
would just type ``programname`` on the command line, but then ``programname``
is also executed. Check if you have xclip installed::

    $ which xclip
    /usr/bin/xclip

It doesn't matter if the path outputted by which is different for you.

Check all programs in one go using xclip and which
==================================================
To check whether you have all programs installed in one go, you can use
``xclip`` and ``which``. Make sure you have xclip installed. Then copy the list
of programs in the top section. Check if you can get the copied text from xclip
now::
    
    $ xclip -o
    xclip
    bowtie2
    bowtie2-build
    velveth
    velvetg
    parallel
    tablet
    samtools

Store the output of xclip in a variable and iterate over the programs calling
``which`` on each of them::

    $ req_progs=$(xclip -o)
    $ echo $req_progs
    xclip bowtie2 bowtie2-build velveth velvetg parallel tablet samtools
    $ for p in $req_progs; do which $p || echo $p not in PATH; done
    /usr/bin/xclip
    /home/idb/bin/bowtie2
    /home/idb/bin/bowtie2-build
    /home/idb/downloaded_software/velvet_1.2.03/velveth
    /home/idb/downloaded_software/velvet_1.2.03/velvetg
    /usr/local/bin/parallel
    tablet not in PATH
    /home/idb/bin/samtools

As you can see all programs are found, except tablet. If any of the installed
programs is missing, try to install them yourself or ask. If you are having
troubles following these examples, try to find some bash tutorials online next
time you have some time to kill. Educating yourself on how to use the command
line effectively increases your productivity immensely.

(Optional exercise) Check all programs in one go using xclip, parallel and which
================================================================================
The ``parallel`` program can be used to run something over multiple cores in
parallel. Try to rewrite the following statement, which prints the program name
twice, such that it prints the same output as in `Check all programs in one go
using xclip and which`_::
    
    $ xclip -o | parallel echo {} '&&' echo {}
    xclip
    xclip
    bowtie2
    bowtie2
    bowtie2-build
    bowtie2-build
    velveth
    velveth
    velvetg
    velvetg
    parallel
    parallel
    tablet
    tablet
    samtools
    samtools

Of course in this example making the statement execute in parallel is not that
exciting since the execution time is already extremely short. The execution
actually becomes slower than the original. This excercise is merely to gain
familiarity with the parallel syntax.
