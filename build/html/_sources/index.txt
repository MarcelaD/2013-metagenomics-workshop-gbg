   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the Metagenomics Workshop!
=================================================

In this metagenomics workshop we will learn how to:

- Quality trim reads with sickle
- Perform assemblies with velvet
- Map back reads to assemblies with bowtie2
- Compare assemblies and pick the best one
- Annotate contigs

At least a basic knowledge of how to work with the command line is required
otherwise it will be very difficult to follow some of the examples. Have fun!
